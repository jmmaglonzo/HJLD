## Overview

Welcome to my personal project! As a self-taught developer, I am continually exploring and honing my skills, and this project serves as a practical exercise to apply the knowledge I've gained. The goal is not only to create a functional website but also to experiment with Vue.js features and reinforce my understanding of front-end development.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply Vue.js concepts in a real-world scenario.
- Gain hands-on experience with Vue Router for navigation.
- Strengthen my understanding of front-end development practices.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or share insights. This project is a reflection of my learning journey as a self-taught developer, and I'm open to any suggestions or collaborations to enhance my skills further.
